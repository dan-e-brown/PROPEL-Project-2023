## Dan Brown and Omar Valdez PROPEL Project
### This repository holds the dataset revolving the UN's HIV/AIDS summary statistics from the past 30 years (1990-2020).  The categories are broken down by location (country), gender (male/female) and age.  Omar and I were interested in the disease progression that is seen in the ongoing AIDS epidemic.  We wanted to know the rate of new infections that were happenning in a certain country during this recorded period.  Here we present multuiple approaches to quantify and visualize how to figure out Zimbabwe's incidence rate (new infections) from 1990-2020 and further specify which year this rate was the highest.  We were interested to see this answer because we both were slightly familiar with the efforts taken to battle the HIV/AIDS epidemic and wanted to know if our general knowledge macthed up with statistics.
